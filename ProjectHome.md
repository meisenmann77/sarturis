Sarturis provides a framework to create interactive simulations in virtual reality systems. There is a component based approach to reduce complexity and deal with "separation of concerns" and "unification of concepts". Sarturis itself is a small application and a set of component build and integration tools. There are also several component collections covering user interaction, graphical user interfaces, numerical simulation and virtual reality.
